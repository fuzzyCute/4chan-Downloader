# Why did I do this? I don't know
Sometimes I stay awake thinking why would I create such monstrosity, but then I remember Science exists.
This was the first time I ever created something using GUI using Tkinter, and it was quite the jorney.

# How to install this
I created a requires file that is appended to this project.
### To run it:
- Clone this project
- Create a virtual environment (Recommended), If you don't know how [here's a good guide how to create one](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/create-virtual-environment-python-windows-2021-d947c3a3ca78)
- use pip to install the needed modules using the command ``` pip install -r requires.txt ```
-  after installing everything just run the main.py file by doing ``` python main.py ```

and that's it, you're ready to use the app!

# How To Use it
